<p>1.Plastic bottles
    <br />
    2.Cans made of tin, aluminum, and steel (remove the plastic cap!)
    <br />
    3.Dry papers like newspapers, magazines, notebooks and loose-leafs: If the paper is soiled or wet, consider using it in compost! (Composting is great for helping plants grow and can be made from food scraps.)<br />
    4.Flattened cardboard and paperboard: Similar to paper, wet, soiled or greasy boxes can’t be recycled. For things like pizza boxes, if there’s a paper liner at the bottom that kept the box from getting greasy, then you can recycle it with the leftovers and paper removed.
