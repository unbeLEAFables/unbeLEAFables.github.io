<p>Items that you wouldn’t throw into the regular garbage bin are rarely acceptable as a recyclable. This includes batteries, electronics devices, propane cylinders, medical waste, or car parts.
</p>
<p>
Just because an item has the recycling arrows mark, it doesn’t not mean its recyclable. You have to look into the guidelines of your local community. What can be recycled in Chicago can be different from what’s allowed in San Jose for example. The sign only means it’s recyclable somewhere. The symbol actually has TWO meanings: it’s recyclable (plain logo) or it’s made of recycled materials (logo inside of a black circle.)
